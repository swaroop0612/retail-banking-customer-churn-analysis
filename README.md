# retail-banking-customer-churn-analysis
Machine learning and business intelligence approach for customer churn prediction in retail banking


This repository contains the implementation and analysis for the research project
**“Understanding Customer Retention Patterns in Retail Banking Using Data-Driven Approaches.”**

The project integrates exploratory data analysis, machine learning models,
risk-based customer segmentation, and Power BI dashboards to support
data-driven churn prediction and retention strategies.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior patterns related to churn
- Identify high-risk customer segments
- Compare machine learning models for churn prediction
- Provide business insights using interactive dashboards

---

## 📊 Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Validation  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering and Scaling  
4. Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
5. Churn Probability Estimation  
6. Risk Segmentation  
7. Business Intelligence Visualization (Power BI)
